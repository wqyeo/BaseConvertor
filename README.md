# BaseConvertor
Made this Base Convertor on a really board day.

## How it works
Converts a value of Base N to Base M.
> It converts the value to Base 10 first, then to the targetted Base.

## Usage
There is a dummy console project to test the Library.<br>
You can use the Library by just calling `BaseConvertor.Convertor.Convert(value, baseValue, targetBase)`.
